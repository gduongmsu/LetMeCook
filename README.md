# Recipe Lookup System

## Overview
This project is a **recipe and ingredient management system** that allows users to:
- Add and manage ingredients
- Create and store recipes
- Search and filter recipes (by pantry, allergies, or dietary restrictions)
- Track health reports (calories, sodium, sugar) per meal
- Create accounts with personalized settings

The system will feature a **web-based interface (HTML/JS frontend)**, a **backend API (Python/Logic Apps)**, and a **SQL database** for storing recipes and nutritional data. Docker will be used to containerize services and ensure smooth integration.

## Short-Term Objectives
In the first 2–3 weeks, we aim to:
1. Set up the GitHub repository and Trello board  
2. Define the initial database schema for ingredients, recipes, and tags  
3. Create a basic HTML prototype for the user interface  
4. Establish Docker environment for backend development  
5. Assign roles based on team strengths

## Product Components
### Backend
- Store ingredients with nutrition tags (calories, sodium, sugar, etc.)  
- Store recipes with metadata and ingredient lists  

### User Interface
- Add/manage ingredients  
- Create new recipes  
- Search and filter recipes  
- Track health reports per meal  
- User account creation and login

## Team Agreement

### Team Cohesion
We strive to be a **gelled team**: developing trust, adapting to challenges, and working with a shared identity.  

- **Collaboration:** Open communication, consistent participation, accountability.  
- **Respect for Work Styles:** Blend independent contributions with group work.  
- **Team Building:** Stay flexible with scheduling, respect deadlines, and provide constructive feedback.  

### Strengths
- **Backend & Data Handling:** SQL, Python, Logic Apps, Docker  
- **Frontend & User Interface:** HTML, JavaScript  
- **System Integration:** APIs, containers  

### Roles & Responsibilities
- **Frontend Lead (HTML/JS):** UI layout, search/filter forms  
- **Backend Lead (Python/Logic Apps):** APIs, health report generation  
- **Database Lead (SQL):** Schema design, queries, recipe/ingredient storage  
- **DevOps/Integration (Docker, GitHub):** Environment setup, version control, testing  
- **Project Tracking (Trello/Canvas):** Sprint planning, task assignment, progress reporting  

Roles may rotate to ensure shared learning, but each member maintains ownership of their area.

### Communication & Availability
- Primary: Canvas group page, GitHub Issues  
- Quick discussions: Discord/Slack (TBD)  
- Response time: within 24 hours on weekdays  
- Urgent issues: direct contact via Discord/phone  

### Conflict Resolution
1. Discuss directly  
2. Bring to group  
3. Involve instructor if unresolved  

### Definition of Success
By the end of the semester, we expect:  
- A functional web app with recipe search and ingredient tracking  
- User accounts with dietary/allergy settings  
- Accurate database integration with nutrition tags  
- Usable, reliable, and well-documented deliverables  

### Risk Management
- **Scope Creep:** Core features first (ingredients, recipes, search)  
- **Time Management:** Weekly check-ins to adjust workloads  
- **Technology Risks:** Validate Docker, APIs, and database early with small test builds  

### Measuring Progress
- **GitHub:** Version control and contributions per member  
- **Trello:** Sprint tasks, Kanban board for ownership and progress  
- **Check-ins:** Weekly syncs to review and adjust goals  
- **Ticket Policy:** Limit of one active ticket per person (can be moved back for revisions)  

### Development Workflow
- **Methodology:** Agile (iterative, Kanban-based)  
- **Class Time:** Dedicated to collaborative work (planning, integration, shared challenges)  
- **After-Class:** Independent contributions, with optional partner/small-group work  
- **Future Collaboration:** Extra group meetings if needed  
- **Workflow Tools:** Trello (Kanban), GitHub (version control), Canvas (documentation)
